# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I struggled most with calling out a single key value and listing the Object as a whole. 

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I feel note taking has taken a downword spiral. They have become less coherent and I rely on the lesson plans and the replits more than anything. I am finding that I wish during lessons I could make a diagram of the subject (i.e. functions) to refer back to when making new ones.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

Solve problem on my own for sure! I find googling to be difficult most of the times. I feel that a lot of what I come across is formatted differently and tends to confuse me.
